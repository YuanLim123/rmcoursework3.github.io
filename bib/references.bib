abstract = {Most transit agencies are trying to increase their ridership. To achieve this goal, they are looking to maintain or even improve their level of service. This is very hard, since traffic congestion is normally increasing. As a result, bus travel times are higher and less reliable, which makes harder to predict travel times and avoid bunching. Being able to accurately predict bus travel speeds and update this prediction with real-time information could improve the quality and reliability of the information given to users, and increase the effectiveness of control schemes. In this work we implement and compare different machine learning methods (Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Bayes Networks) to predict bus travel speeds using real-time information about traffic conditions. The proposed algorithms are compared against two common approaches used to predict travel speeds. In order to feed our models, we apply traffic shockwaves theory to select our predictors. The input data used in each model was the speed obtained and processed from GPS devices installed in each of the buses from Transantiago, the public transportation system from Santiago, Chile. Two types of speed were available: historical speed and a real-time speed, each for a given route segment and day period. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can outperform naïve predictions that use either only historical data or only real-time data with a 10-min delay. In particular, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm achieved the best results, obtaining improvements of up to 23% in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the best benchmark model, and up to 3.3% in the RMSE versus the second best machine learning algorithm studied. Moreover, we validated our hypothesis that real-time data helps improve the accuracy of predictions up to 35% in the RMSE.}

ABSTRACT = {Public transportation is a vital service provided to enable a community to carry out daily activities. One of the mass transportations used in an area is a bus. Moreover, the smart transportation concept is an integrated application of technology and strategy in the transportation system. Using smart idea is the key to the application of the Internet of Things. The ways to improve the management transportation system become a bottleneck for the traditional data analytics solution, one of the answers used in machine learning. This paper uses the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for the best prediction of travel time with a lower error rate on a case study of a university shuttle bus. Apart from predicting the travel time, this study also considers the fuel cost and gas emission from transportation. The analysis of the experiment shows that the ANN outperformed the SVM. Furthermore, a recommender system is used to recommend suitable routes for the chosen scenario. The experiments extend the discussion with a range of future directions on the stipulated field of study.},

ABSTRACT = {Travel time data is an important factor for evaluating the performance of a public transport system. In terms of time and space within the nature of uncertainty, bus travel time is dynamic and flexible. Since the change of traffic status is periodic, contagious or even sudden, the changing mechanism of that is a hidden mode. Therefore, bus travel time prediction is a challenging problem in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Allowing for a large amount of traffic data can be collected at present but lack of precisely-conducting, it is still worth exploring how to extract feature sets that can accurately predict bus travel time from these data. Hence, a feature extraction framework based on the deep learning models were developed to reflect the state of bus travel time. First, the study introduced different historical stages of bus signaling time, taxi speed, the stop identity (ID) of spatial characteristics, and real-time possible arrival time, signified by fourteen spatiotemporal characteristic values. Then, an embedding network is proposed to leverage a wide and deep structure to mate the spatial and temporal data. In order to meet the temporal dependence requirements, an attention mechanism for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was designed in this research in order to capture the temporal information. Finally, a Deep Neural Networks (DNN) was implemented in this research in order to achieve the dynamic bus travel time prediction. Two case studies of Guangzhou and Shenzhen were tested. The results showed that the performance of the algorithm was more efficient than that of the traditional machine-learning model and promoted by 4.82% compared to the deep neural network applied to the initial feature space. Moreover, the study visualized the weighted cost of attention on the bus’s travel time features during a certain running state. Therefore, the study demonstrated the proposed model enabled to understand the characteristic data of transit travel time with visualization.},
